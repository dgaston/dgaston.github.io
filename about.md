I'm a Clinical Bioinformatician supporting Next-Generation Sequencing-based
diagnostics with a focus on Oncology and Hematological Malignancies. I am also an
Assistant Professor in the Department of Pathology at Dalhousie University.

### More Information

My background ranges from molecular evolutionary theory to clinical genomics in
humans. I did my PhD work in the lab of Dr. Andrew Roger studying the mechanisms
underlying functional divergence in proteins and developing new phylogenomic
techniques for studying this process. I then did a Post-Doctoral Fellowship with
Dr. Karen Bedeard as part of the IGNITE project, searching for genetic mutations
underlying rare Mendelian diseases in Atlantic Canada.
