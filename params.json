{"name":"dgaston.github.io","tagline":"","body":"dgaston.github.io\r\n=================\r\n\r\n<p>I am a post-doctoral fellow currently working with the <a href=\"http://igniteproject.ca/\">IGNITE</a> project studying the causes of, and\r\ndeveloping therapeutics for, orphan genetic diseases found in families living in Atlantic Canada. In addition to performing\r\nroutine genomic/bioinformatic analyses, I am also developing new tools for genomics researchers. My focus is currently\r\non data management/visualization and gene prioritization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously I did my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Roger working on molecular phylogenetics. There my thesis work\r\n  focused on developing new tools for understanding the process of functional divergence of protein families and in using\r\n  phylogenomic methods for performing high-throughput localization prediction in genomic datasets. See FunDi and CBOrg\r\n  below.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\n<a name=\"designer-templates\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#designer-templates\"><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Projects</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dgaston.github.io/FunDi/\">FunDi</a>: A phylogenetic mixture model designed to identify amino acids contributing to the functional divergence between two sub-groups\r\nof a protein family</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dgaston.github.io/CBOrg/\">CBOrg</a>:Comparative BLAST for Organelles.
