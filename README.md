=================

<p>I am a post-dcotoral fellow currently working with the <a href="http://igniteproject.ca/">IGNITE</a> project studying the causes of, and
developing therapeutics for, orphan genetic diseases found in families living in Atlantic Canada. In addition to performing
routine genomic/bioinformatic analyses, I am also developing new tools for genomics researchers. My focus is currently
on data management/visualization and gene prioritization.</p>

<p>Previously I did my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Andrew Roger working on molecular phylogenetics. There my thesis work
  focused on developing new tools for understanding the process of functional divergence of protein families and in using
  phylogenomic methods for performing high-throughput localization prediction in genomic datasets. See FunDi and CBOrg
  below.

<p><a href="http://dgaston.github.io/FunDi/">FunDi</a>: A phylogenetic mixture model designed to identify amino acids contributing to the functional divergence between two sub-groups
of a protein family</p>

<p><a href="http://dgaston.github.io/CBOrg/">CBOrg</a>:Comparative BLAST for Organelles. CBOrg is a small GUI interface to a custom set
  of Organellar proteome databases for use with BLAST. Serves as a quick method of identifying potentially organellar targetted
  sequences from EST and High-Throughput sequencing experiments of novel organisms.

<p><a href="http://dgaston.github.io/GenomicsManager/">GenomicsManager</a>: A workflow and organizational tool for tracking bioinformatics
and genomics projects. Stores a local (private) database of genomic variations and provides built in tools for analyses and for interfacing
with various genomics analysis tools.
